                <p class="text-center">This Privacy Notice applies to personal information that we collect through our games, mobile applications and other products ("Games"), and websites we control,(collectively “Services”).</p>
                <h2> 1.What personal information does we collect? </h2>

                <p class="text-center">The personal information we may collect about you through the Services falls into the following general categories:</p>

                <strong>1.1. Information that you provide voluntarily</strong>
                <p class="text-center">Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we may ask for certain information in order to register an account with us, to begin playing Games, to subscribe to marketing communications
                    from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us, such as:</p>

                <p class="text-center"> - your name, email address or other contact details</p>

                <p class="text-center"> - any information you submit to our customer service team in the Game or via email</p>
                <p>The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be explained to you when we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>
                <strong>1.2 Information we collect automatically</strong>

                <p>When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>

                <p>- Your Service communications (e.g. in-game chats and messages with other players)</p>

                <p> - Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-game play progress, levels, games played, session length, preferred settings, which in-game adverts you may have viewed, in-game preferences or just game preferences, which friends
                    you connect with, the means by which you were referred to our Services)
                </p>

                <p> - Your IP address and device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers (for more see here "Advertising IDs and Device IDs")
                </p>

                <p> - Your device type and the operating system that you use
                </p>

                <p> - General geographic location (e.g. country or city location) based on your IP address
                </p>

                <p> - GPS location, with your consent

                </p>
                <p>“Advertising ID” means the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple, and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile devices that advertisers use for interest-based advertising. They are consistent
                    across all apps and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you can opt out by choosing the “limit ad tracking” option in the privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out by choosing the “Opt out of interest based ads.” Advertising
                    IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognize your
                    device when you use websites and applications.</p>
                <p>“Device identifier / information” means device type, device model, device manufacturer, device operating system and language, or other technical data like screen size, processor, or a combination of this data, available from a device for
                    a developer to check the device’s compatibility with a particular application.</p>
                <p>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and/or similar technologies (such as " software development kits, or “SDKs”).</p>
                <strong>1.3 Information we obtain from third party sources</strong>
                <p>(a) Information from social media platforms. You may choose to connect to our Services via your social media account. The exact information we receive from you will depend on your social media privacy settings, but it will typically include

                <p> age range</p>

                <p> your friends playing the same Game</p>
                <p>Typical uses include updating game progress on multiple devices you may own so that you can continue your progress using multiple devices. In addition, we may show your Facebook friends in the Game and show your public Facebook profile
                    name and picture in Game leaderboards and in your Game profile.</p>
                <p> (b) Third party service providers. We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources. We may get your personal information, for example, when you installed our Game or when, prior to installation, you click on an advertisement

                <p>(c) Advertising partners. From time to time, we may also receive personal information about you from other third-party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement directing you to one of our Services (such as an ad for one

                <strong>1.4 No special categories of information</strong>

                <h2>7. DATA RETENTION</h2>

                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or de-identify it, or, if this is not possible _ for example, because your personal information has been stored on a backup server
                    _ then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <h2>8. YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</h2>

                <p>(c) To opt out of marketing communications we send you, at any time by contacting us .</p>
                <p>(d) If we are processing your personal information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will

                <p>(e) You have the right to file a complaint with a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</p>
                <p>You can control and limit the type of personal information we collect and process about you in a number of ways. For example, you can disconnect your social media account(s) from our games or control your social media privacy settings
                    to limit the information shared with us. You can also reset your mobile advertising identifier or limit ad tracking altogether using the settings on your phone. You can also limit or disable the use of cookies (or similar technologies).</p>
                <p>We will respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
